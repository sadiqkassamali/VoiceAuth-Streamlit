FAQ
1. What is VoiceAuth?

VoiceAuth is an application designed to detect deepfake audio files. It uses machine learning models to analyze audio and classify whether it's real or fake.
2. Which models are used for detection?

The app uses three models:

    Random Forest: A machine learning model trained on audio features.
    Melody (Hugging Face): A model based on Hugging Face's transformer-based architecture.
    960h (Hugging Face): Another Hugging Face model trained on a large audio dataset.

3. How do I run the prediction?

    Select an audio file from your computer.
    Choose one or multiple models (Random Forest, Melody, 960h).
    Press the "Run Prediction" button, and the application will analyze the audio and display the results.

4. What kind of audio files can I analyze?

The app supports various formats, including MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, M4A, MP4, AVI, and more.
5. How accurate is the detection?

Accuracy can vary depending on the model and audio quality. The app provides a confidence score for each prediction, allowing you to assess the reliability of the results.
6. Can I donate to support the development?

Yes! You can donate via PayPal.
7. How can I contact support?
